#Download the employees dataset from the resources for this lesson.

#Then, import it into R using your preferred import method.

#This is a large dataset, so limit the import to 200 observations. Note that the dataset has Copyright information in the beginning (23 rows). Any character variables should be stored as characters.

#Rename the variables as follows: "Employee number", "First name", "Last name", "Birth date", "Gender", "Job title", "Salary", "From date", "To date".

#Export the data set you currently have as a CSV, without saving the row names.

#Import it back again to make sure everything is okay.
