#Comparison Operators
x = 2==2
a = 3 !=3
b =1<2
c=2>5
d=2<=5

#Logical Operators with comparisons 

#both conditions must be true to return true
LC1 = (1 < 2) and (2 > 3)

#only a single condition must be true to return true
LC2 = 1==1 or 1==100

#retrunging the oposite of the statement 
LC3=not(1==1)
